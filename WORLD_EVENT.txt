1. How to trigger the event:
Click anywhere to trigger a void rip.

2. What should happen when the event is triggered:
Any click will spawn a smash ball at its location.
The background is changed into a rip in the void for where the click happens.

3. What the affected entities should do:
The newly spawned smash ball floats around randomly.
Any miners or ore blobs caught in the void are transformed into mangoes.

4. What the new entity is and how it should behave:
The mangoes now target smash balls to destroy.
Furthermore, mangoes that destroy the smash balls become masters, who in turn destroy everything in its path.

Perry Ting implemented the initial click effect (removal of entity if present, affect tiles within the area, add a smash ball in its place, and transform all miners/oreblobs within the area), and created all the .bmp images.

Samuel Wong implemented the Master class, Mang0 class, and the SmashBall class alongside all their respective data, moving patterns, execution, and functions that allow for their operation.
